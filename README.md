# Feature Engineering for Layover Assignment in Flight Data

## Project Description
This project focuses on the assignment of layover values within a dataset of flight routes. The primary goal is to enhance the dataset by feature engineering, specifically by calculating and assigning layover times using a newly created variable, `total_air_time`. The project leverages Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
